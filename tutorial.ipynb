Even though it was always in the back of my mind when I got into university, I hadn't thought of a project that could have the impact I strived for, or even something that I was capable of doing with my limited skills. That is, until October 2020."

But I kept trying to learn new things and not lose hope that someday I'd be good enough to do something to help."

Their theme was: \"Inovative ways of improving people's quality of life\". I instantly got excited and talked to my female friends from university, setting up a team of four: Me (of course), Milena Corrêa, Ana Vitória Freitas and Luísa Balleroni."

It's an open source Telegram bot that mimics a restaurant, using hidden menus and commands to help women in danger and abusive situations in general. The goal is to look as real as possible as to not alarm the abusers that might be nearby or even watching the conversation take place. I'll link our GitHub accounts and the project's code below, where you can find a more detailed explanation of our work (I'll try to translate it as soon as possible!)."

It's confusing and often really hard to understand what exactly everything does, specially if you're dealing with more \"robust\" functions.
